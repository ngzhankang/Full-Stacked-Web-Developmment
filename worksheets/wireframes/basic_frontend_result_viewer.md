## Justifications

### [Justification 1 - Result Viewer](https://www.eventbrite.sg/d/singapore--singapore/events--this-weekend/music-festival/?page=1)

![Justification1 - Result Viewer](assets/FSP_Justification_Result_Viewer_1.jpeg)

#### Good Points

1. Information such as date, time, location and price are displayed quite clearly.
2. Show in 'row - direction' manner such that the message can be spreaded over a larger area and that the banner can be shown clearly.  
3. They have a share button which allows the person to share the wesite/event with friends/relatives.

#### Bad Points

1. Maybe they could show the popularity of the shows so that people can decide if its worth.

### [Justification 2 - Result Viewer](https://www.vividseats.com/Search.action?searchTerm=Chicago)

![Justification 2 - Result Viewer](assets/FSP_Justification_Result_Viewer_2.png)

#### Good Points

1. Shows all search results/filter results in rows, which is neat.
2. Shows the time and the date explicitly beside the name of the festival.
3. Beautiful UI/UX at the top of the search queries.

#### Bad Points

1. Maybe they could show the popularity of the shows so that people can decide if its worth.
2. They could have add in more filters like time filters because the most they filter for time is just day or night and not numeric timing filters.

### [Justification 3 - Result Viewer](https://guides.ticketmaster.co.uk/festival-finder/?filter=1&tmp=2&camefrom=CFC_Festival_Finder&tm_link=festivalfinder&price=1%2C300&age%5B%5D=adult&festival-search-category%5B%5D=281&festival-search-category%5B%5D=293&festival-search-category%5B%5D=307&festival-search-category%5B%5D=288&festival-search-category%5B%5D=286&festival-search-category%5B%5D=283&festival-search-category%5B%5D=294&festival-search-category%5B%5D=287&duration%5B%5D=single&location_type%5B%5D=city&submit=Submit+Query)

![Justification 3 - Result Viewer](assets/FSP_Justification_Result_Viewer_3.png)

#### Good Points

1. Simplistic UI design that is more suitable/friendly for the younger people.
2. Short and brief description of each event and festivcals so that users can be more curious and then explore more of each events.
3. When hovered over each tiles,there will be a description of the headliners for the user to read.

#### Bad Points

1. Does not show the timing only until the user click on the buy now button, which redirects them to a new tab/webpage.
